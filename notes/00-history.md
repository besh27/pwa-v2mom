## History of the Term "PWA"
- The term "pwa" was coined in 2014 by Alex Russel and Jake Archibald, who are Google Developer advocates that work closely on the Chrome team.
- The name represents its intent. Apps that are no longer looking at the oldest most limited browser that we have to support, but rather adopting this idea of progressive enhancement. The lowest common denominator that is driving the way we think anymore.
- PWAs are about building rich experiences with superhero characteristics for modern browsers that can support it and then gracefully, degrading or falling back to a more basic experience.
