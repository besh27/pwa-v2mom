# 10 Characteristics of a PWA

| Characteristic | Explanation |
|----------------|-------------|
| Progressive | progressive in that they work for a variety of browsers. |
| Responsive | They're responsive because mobile web traffic has eclipsed desktop traffic in every way. In page views, in number of unique users, we're past every benchmark that we care about. Mobile web that is not the niche experience anymore, it is the the main sharer of most business' traffic.|
| Works Offline | progressive web apps should work regardless of flaky or absent network connections. And this is traditionally, a big limitation that you have to deal with when building for the web. If you have no Internet, you can't download that java script for that CSS, your AJAX doesn't work. These are things we need in order to do anything interesting at all. |
| App-Like | Progressive web apps are app like, meaning you are prompted to add them to your home screen with the home screen icon, and you can launch them from there, potentially without the browser UI. Like the back button in the bookmark button, it can be a sort of full screen web experience that a user might forget that they didn't get this from the App Store.  |
| Fresh | PWAs should get up to date content when it's available without a complex installation process.|
| Safe | Requires HTTPS. |
| Discoverable | WAs are discoverable so they should have rich metadata associated with different URLs so that when you search on a search engine, you got a rich tile that comes back with all that needs structuring data around it. And not sort of the Wikipedia article approach, which is quite basic by today's standards. |
| Re-Engagable | PWA should be re-engageable in the form of notifications. Meaning the user can do something, close their tab, walking away, and then get a notification that sorta pulls them back into the app. |
| Durable | PWA should be durable and by that we mean they should be able to store data in a way that survives across different browser tab lifetimes. This isn't by using cookies, local storage, things like that. PWAs store data in a way that it doesn't evaporate as soon as the user walks away.|
| Linkable | PWAs are web technology, thus can make use of URLs, not like apps that use deeplinks, like 'Spotify://...' |
